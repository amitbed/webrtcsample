# Assignment
1. There's a bug in the code. Video stream from the camera should work, but due to a bug, the video stream is not working. Find the bug and fix it.
2. replace the switchCameraButton in the activity_main with a new button named "touchPaneButton" that will: 
   - Open a new white and empty fragment
   - Capture the user's touch on that screen (x and y coordinates only)
   - Coordinates will be sent to the other peer using a data channel from webrtc protocol 
   - Only if the other peer will press on the "touchPaneButton" button on his phone, that will open the white fragment, a small red circle will be drawn on the screen every time it gets a new <x,y> coordinates. The drawn circle will be proportionally to the peerâ€™s screen size. 
   - Of course, both peers will be able to touch their screens and see the touches of the other peer 
   - Make sure that the solution applies on a real device (not only on an emulator)
   - Make sure you support different types touches (swipe/ scroll / multi-touch/ point)
